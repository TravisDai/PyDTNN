# PyDLLib
## A Light-Weight Library for Distributed Training of Deep Neural Networks

PyDLLib is a DNN framework that aims for the simplicity of the user's interaction while offering an HPC solution.

This framework offers both sequential and distributed training modes exploiting, in the second scenario, the data-parallelism approach.
