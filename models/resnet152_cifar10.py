""" Python Distributed Training of Neural Networks - PyDTNN

PyDTNN is a light-weight library for distributed Deep Learning training and 
inference that offers an initial starting point for interaction with 
distributed training of (and inference with) deep neural networks. PyDTNN 
priorizes simplicity over efficiency, providing an amiable user interface 
which enables a flat accessing curve. To perform the training and inference 
Ã§processes, PyDTNN exploits distributed inter-process parallelism (via MPI) 
for clusters and intra-process (via multi-threading) parallelism to leverage 
the presence of multicore processors and GPUs at node level. For that, PyDTNN 
uses MPI4Py for message-passing, BLAS calls via NumPy for multicore processors
and PyCUDA+cuDNN+cuBLAS for NVIDIA GPUs.
